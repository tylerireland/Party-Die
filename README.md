# Party-Die

## Description

Party Die was a midterm project for my intro to C++ class. I took this class in sinclair so I had already had some experience with other coding languages like python and java. I decided to make a dice rolling game where each number indicates a certain instruction to do. The original version of this game is a drinking game, however I only decided to make it that becuase it was the first thing I thought of. (I never actually played this game, because the numbers I put down are ridiculous!). I decided to add a little bit more to this project. I added a custom game mode where the user can choose instructions to do for landing on a custom roll. So instead of rolling snake eyes and taking a shot, I could make a rule where landing on two 2's would mean I have to do 20 push-ups.
